_”It looks like our existing PenScope scheme code calculates the number of complete months 1/7/2014 to 31/12/2014 as 5 months instead of 6 for the purposes of the RPI pro rating. We can amend this, but firstly I think we should have admin confirm whether they require the pro-rated first year increases, as their calcs don’t seem to include it for the 3% cumulative increase calculation._

 _Could someone query this with admin and let us know how we should proceed?”_

They’ll need to provide a revised PINC spec as confirmation too.

The admin manager has advised the 3% cumulative calc should work in exactly the same way as the other elements of pension in excess of GMP in terms of the proportionate increase to apply.

I’ve reviewed the spec and can’t see a change is needed (sorry, still new to specs)

To make it clear, the question is, should 1/7/2014 to 31/12/2014 equal 5 months or 6?

We’re seeing more tickets where calcs are failing with an error relating to CPension Splits.

As you identified, this is happening because there's no 'normal' post com elements left, after having changed the cash calculation formula from using 0.15 to 0.15034965, only GMP and the temp pension are left, and penscope can't handle trying to adjust the post com pension to round by 12.

I’ve referred this to admin and they have confirmed Non-GMP is fine to equal Zero as long as GMP at GMP age is covered and is higher than £500.

David has provided this example and confirmed they would like to use Option 2 (column D, cell 53+)

\\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\BAA\HelpDesks\INC0211669 - CPension Split Issue\BPO calc - 1505452 Female NRD Old Scheme Under Max BP with GMPv4.xlsx

There is also this example,

\\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\BAA\HelpDesks\INC0211669 - CPension Split Issue\BPO calc - 1515096 Female Over NRD Old Scheme Under Max BP with GMP.xlsx

This member still has normal Pre 97 pension, but guessing not enough.  There are 4 worksheets as follows:

Late4Yrs-Fails PS - calc fails in Penscope
Late7Yrs-Runs PS - calc runs in Penscope
Early1Yr-Runs PS - calc runs in Penscope
Normal-Fails PS - calc fails in Penscope

I’ve included screen prints within the spreadsheet so you can see my date inputs.

How do we handle these ones, as if we use Option 2 as above, the results are exactly the same as the original results in the manual calc (if that makes sense).

There is also a copy of the error in the folder:

Recode is required for BAA PINCs process so that it works for the 38 cases whose GMP plus annual increases will be treated as an underpin compared to their PIE pension.

The following Notional element has been set up by Apps:

**

Summary of requirements:

Add a warning to the start of the process that prompts Admin to check that the records for these members have been set up correctly.

Enable Admin to add the increase percentage against new notional elements that will be created.

Apply the percentage added in step 2 to the notional elements.

Identify whether the sum of the new values of the notional elements are higher than the sum of the PIE elements (which are non increasing), and if so, to include the notional elements into the total new value instead of the PIE elements.

Add a Y/N marker on the output for when the sum of the notional elements have exceeded the sum of the PIE elements.

Add a warning at the end of the process that will prompt Admin to update the records for the members where the underpin has bitten (Admin would have to zero the notional elements, create normal GMP elements, zero the PIE elements, and create notional PIE elements. The notional PIE elements would be non increasing, and would not be added into the total pension in payment, so the PINCS route can completely disregard them).

They state they attached the correct tables which need to be populated in the Compass transfer spreadsheets - the precise names of these tables on the Ekon general statistics page are as follows:
a) Section 101 Ord. (Sch 2 PSA08)
Introduced for pensions earned after 6 April 2009 (ie: this index will not go back 30 years) and reflects RPI increases up to September 2009 and CPI increases beyond this date. 
b) Section 52A Ord. (RPI replica)

Looks like there was confusion from admin.  They sent us Section101 orders but labelled them S52A.  They have now sent the correct factor table and I have saved it in the location.

They have also asked “As these are standard revaluation orders, any chance you can ask Matt to add a dynamic reference so these stats are updated automatically each year without us needing to raise a ticket please?”  I would presume that is a straight No and a ticket needs to be raised?

I believe this is due to new tranches having been added and the ERF not having been coded to these.

For existing members that joined before 1 April 1996 this should be using the 5% fixed ERFs present in the system and for 1997 and existing post 1 April 1996 joiners this should be using the LPI increase ERFs present in the system.

Calc spec is correct, however calc doesn’t seem to be working as spec.

Although this Jira is still in To Do and not passed yet to Readiness Review, I thought I'd add some background.

My recollection is run time inputs were discussed between us during the simplification work, with the guidance being no action being required from me regarding run time inputs during the simplification project.

Below I'll paste an email from 31/01/2025, but in essence it is saying it looks like some RAC inputs are conditional on data. If that data changed as part of the simplification, then run time inputs, and the code using those inputs, could be affected.

Note how the 2 inputs you list below are 2 of the ones showing on the spreadsheet with conditional sql.

The three points at the end of the email, which were not addressed during the simplification work, are relevant to this Jira, and will need analysing with test cases provided covering the inputs, and how the inputs affect the calculation.



Email 31/01/2025

Hi Callum,

 

I’ve queried the backend end tables and these are the RAC run time inputs:

\\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Calculation development\Projects\RAC Simplification\4. MISC\run time inputs\Run Time Inputs.xlsx

 

Note different inputs show depending on whether it is run as Options or Final.

 

I see that these have conditional_sql, which looks like it controls when to and not to show the input.

I’ve looked at input ‘RAC Pre 97 Excess - PR97 RAC003 AVC Fund’ for category ‘RAC097 - Standard’ for Early Retirement from Deferred.

 

The conditional SQL seems to be saying that if the category has the word ‘Enhanced’ in it, then look at the member’s transfer in elements and if any link to a pension element ‘RAC Pre 97 Excess - PR97 RAC003’ then show the input. If the category does not have the word ‘Enhanced’ in it, then look at the member’s deferred elements to see if any link to a pension element ‘RAC Pre 97 Excess - PR97 RAC003’, and if so, show the input.

 

So if a member has deferred element ‘Pre 97 Increasing Excess - PR97 RAC003’ for category ‘RAC097 - Standard’, then then input shows when running options.

 

Some of those inputs might no longer be used - for example I couldn’t see any tranches linked to a pension element ‘Basic MCTS’.

 

So there are three angles to this, given that deferred and pension elements are changing:

# Are any existing run time inputs linked to pension elements that are changing - if so do the inputs need changing and the criteria to show them

# Are any transfer in elements or deferred elements changing that are associated to the pension elements behind the inputs

# How does this effect calculation functionality","21/Nov/25 3:19 PM;621ce5ee932f0f007165b575;Having spoken with admin and provided full clarity on the situation, they have accepted that this issue is more complicated than they hoped.  They are collating together some worked examples incorporating the new pre97 splits and thus the new AVC runtime inputs and how they work within the calculation.  ‘On Hold’ until further notice, I believe their commutation changes (awaiting tickets) are to take priority and then move back onto this.  ([~accountid:712020:e960b04b-2df7-4f4b-bce8-14ee0e29228c] for info) ","27/Jan/26 12:14 PM;712020:13c3ecf6-3acc-46c9-8a87-b6773774a9ac;Hi[~accountid:712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7] [~accountid:712020:e960b04b-2df7-4f4b-bce8-14ee0e29228c] .  Now that the commutation changes have been done we need to restart this one please.  However, there appears to be more to the SNOW ticket than just missing runtime inputs as they are also asking for a new AVC conversation factor table to be added and then for these to be matched to the relevant AVC inputs.  

I have added a spreadsheet to the SNOW ticket folder (file path above) which gives a description of the changes required and the tables etc.  I understand that items 1 & 2 in the spreadsheets were covered by the commutation changes so aren't required here.   The folder also now includes an example of what used to happen before the runtime inputs disappeared but I can't find any worked test cases for the changes despite there being a note on the ticket that we have everything.  Have these been provided elsewhere?  If not i’ll request some.  thanks ","29/Jan/26 12:57 PM;712020:e960b04b-2df7-4f4b-bce8-14ee0e29228c;Hi [~accountid:712020:13c3ecf6-3acc-46c9-8a87-b6773774a9ac] ,

Noted. 

Is there an overall breakdown anywhere of the category / input combinations that are now missing?

I wasn’t aware of any additional requests re AVC factor tables.  Looking at the directory (*\\ad.xafinity.com\wokingham\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\Aviva - RAC\HelpDesks\INC0199018 - AVC runtime input missing*) no test cases appear to be present covering that requirement.

A wider discussion may need to be had on whether this item is put on hold until the calcs have been updated to account for GMPe (cc’ing in [~accountid:712020:379ee819-d969-4af1-a2dd-ab2ccf81df5a]  [~accountid:6267ed2b357b9f006e4b8c69] for visibility).

I’ve moved the ticket to Further info required for the time being.

I can revert the calculation back to how it was in Prod then just redo the changes to SPD and how the salary data is expected. This still carries risk and would still need a proper UAT and sign off from the admin team.

Alternatively I can investigate the issue raised and see if I can work out how to resolve this based on the current calculation code that is in CALCUAT - this is likely to take longer for me to make the change and again would require a proper UAT and sign off.

They need to pick an option.

One question that I think needs to be answered before I do anything though is have they made sure the data in CALCUAT is the same as Prod? I’d understood there was a data change being made to Service Periods to change all start dates to the 6th of the month and all end dates to the 5th of the month. I cannot access Prod to check the data is the same in both systems","16/Oct/25 1:16 PM;712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29;Response from admin:  [~accountid:640f34fc1273131f2adfede9] are you able to answer their questions?

Yes, there were changes made to PROD data, with regards to the service periods so a calc update wasn't needed to resolve the issues surrounding this. We believe that there is probably a lot of data that is not in the same situation and a refresh would ideally be needed to capture these changes.

Please can you confirm what various changes were made to the A2D calc, as we only had 2 outstanding A2D tickets which were signed off on for the push to prod, that we were aware of due to the changes in the ticketing system. Are there older fixes that were not pushed at the time and have only recently gone live, as we note a lot of our older tickets were closed without confirmation of the push to PROD.

Once you have confirmed the above, we can decide the best way froward.","03/Nov/25 10:19 AM;640f34fc1273131f2adfede9;[~accountid:712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29] I’d understood it was made clear to the admin team that the last push to Prod would be exactly what was in Calcuat.

On review, it appears that the current code version in LIVE is *4.1.0.0*, while CALCTEST and CALCDEV are on version *4.1.0.1*. The differences stem from changes previously made for this scheme, which have been in UAT since October 2023 (please see email saved: \\ad.xafinity.com\London\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\Kier\Calculations\Mouchel Schemes\Helpdesks\INC0187033\Email Correspondence). From our understanding, no testing of these changes has ever occurred.

As the updates previously made relate to the application of factors, and the IMPS-569 query also concerns this same area, could we get the admin team to please test the calculation in CALCTEST to confirm whether the reported issue still occurs?

From what I understand the CARE revaluation should already be using 2 methods and paying the higher of.  The correction required is to the ERFs being used as the amounts revalued by s52a/s101 should have ERF1 applied and the amounts revalued by Mouchel care reval should have ERF2 applied.

Is this two items in one? Sounds like there is an issue at play (wrong comm factor being applied for an element) and a new scheme recode required to account for Salary linkage.

Is it worth separating out these two items? On face value, the comm factor request is relatively minor and could be squeezed in as a standard SNOW ticket.

I’d advise that the salary linkage requirement is logged as a project under [https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SNOW/boards/597?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMjQ1NTNmY2U2MTRjNGI0ZjhiMzgyNTdmMjM0MDBlZGUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9|https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SNOW/boards/597?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMjQ1NTNmY2U2MTRjNGI0ZjhiMzgyNTdmMjM0MDBlZGUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9|smart-link] . 

Looking at the directory advised (\\ad.xafinity.com\wokingham\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\C Brewer\Phase 2)… There are a lot of spreadsheets, documents etc. Not sure whether it’ll be worth cleaning up before passing over to the calcs team? And then perhaps organising a formal handover call. I can’t quite make heads or tails of what the exact ask is and what has been updated in the spec etc.

Incorrect Revaluation Factor and Future Revaluation Factor being used

Hi, I was running an Early Retirement Quote and Aurora is pulling the wrong reval factor. From date of leaving to the retirement date is 26 years and Aurora is using 25 years. This means Aurora is using 5 years to calculate the future reval when it should be 4 years. I have attached a copy of our manual calc. Can this be investigated?

The figures are incorrect where it is showing full pension and residual pension. The beginning of PDF should show the revaluation factor and future revaluation factor that Aurora has used.

The procedure carried out is as follows:

# Lookup the latest S52, S101 year that is available (currently 2025)
# Lookup the year of date of calculation (could be DOR, or the specific elements normal pension age date / normal retirement date depending on DOR)
# Calculate the complete number of years from date of leaving to date of calculation above.
# Calculate future unknown years by taking the year of date of calculation and minus the latest s52/s101. 
# Known years is therefore complete years - future years.

In the case provided in the ticket this would translate as follows:  

# Latest S52 = 2025
# Year of date of calculation = 2030 (Each element has a normal pension age date of 01/05/2030).
# Complete number of years from DOL 30/06/1999 to normal pension age date above = 30.
# Future years is 2030 - 2025 = 5
# Known years to use is 30 - 5 = 25. 

Would you mind going back to admin to confirm this for me please, I believe this ticket should be closed down as the global revaluation procedure was previously agreed to be used on this scheme with Ricky McConnell. 

Thanks,

Steven

Sorry to chase (again) but admin have chased me for an update, as they have another case.

The Post 97 has the correct reval factor (14 years) but their Post 06 and Post 09 element is using 13 year reval factor on Aurora.

I have saved the Aurora calc and manual calc in here for reference:

As admin don’t agree with global revaluation procedure, we need to override this method. 

Could you please provide the detailed steps or a proforma to assist in coding the bespoke revaluation module? I reviewed the spreadsheets attached in ticket INC0187169, but the values are hard-coded, so having the exact steps would be helpful.

I’ve reviewed this and only a minor change is required. Could you kindly review the script where {{rounding_pension}} is set to  '2'? In the template, this appears as ""up""  which is 0.

There is an element named {{Rounding Pension}} in the rounding order which is set to 0. If unnecessary, we might consider removing it from the script. I've noticed that in M&G set up, the rounding order for {{Rounding Pension}} is set to 9. Please can you review if it needs to be set as 9 or it is not required.

Thank you for updating the script.

I would like to double-check the rounding order for the Rounding Pension. It seems that this element has been removed from the script, preventing updates on the {{pinc_pension_rounding_order}} table, although it is present in the Pension Element Details.

We believe the rounding order should include ALL elements within the scheme. Could you please confirm the rounding order for the Rounding Pension?

Admin have confirmed Rounding Order element is no longer used, however as this is an element on Penscope I have added as rounding 9.  However I have also noted this is the same scenario as Pre88GMP, AVCPension1 and AVCPension2.  There are no members who use these elements.

Would you prefer admin to raise a ticket with ITAPPS to have these actual elements removed, then I will remove from the PINCs spec?  or are we ok having these at the end knowing none are in use?

PSA went live on XPS Penscope around August 2024. Prior to this, PSA was using ITMs version of Penscope, and upon migration, we mirrored the ITM current Penscope calcs to XPS Penscope.
Upon UAT testing, we identified that the Retirement Calculations with AVCs weren't producing the same figures as the ITM Penscope Calculations.
I've attached a file with an example calculation showing the differences, together with some notes on how the AVC options should be calculated.

I have reviewed the calculation and it appears that the relevant AVC factors are missing…

I’ve spoken to Lumera and have been provided with the missing factor tables ('Peugeot - AVC Final Increase' and ‘Peugeot - AVC Inc Perc - Half Yearly'). These factor tables are now being utilised by the calculations in CALCTEST.  Please note, the 'Peugeot - AVC Inc Perc - Half Yearly’ table looks to be slightly out of date, with the last entry dating to 01/04/2022.

The factor tables, example calculation prints, and overview of what the AVC calcs are doing have been saved: \\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\PSA\HelpDesks\INC0184034 - AVC Calc Fix\DL Changes.

Could you please liaise with admin to try and identify whether ‘Peugeot - AVC Inc Perc - Half Yearly' needs updated to include new factor values added? 

I’m hoping that this explains the discrepancies being reported by admin though.

Let me know if you need any more information.

Naomi has investigated, coded and tested the fix for this issue.

Work performed:

* Reviewed global code and confirmed a max vs potential PCLS check is already performed when calculating max lump sum.
* Added in a Log to Glasgow which shows the workings for Option 2 and Option 3, so admin can see the PCLS percentage taken.
* Noted that the *_target cash calc_* will automatically cap (so if max available was £9,300 and you enter a target of £9,400, it will cap to £9,300. Warning added to indicate this cap has been applied).
* Tested 18 D>R calcs. The only member showing the error ""Percentage of PCLS taken is greater than 25%."" is member 820661 (D>R). This is because they have a transfered in deferred element and are already flagged for a manual calc, so the code is not correctly calculating PCLS, as anticipated.
* Tested 12 A>R calcs. All passed (No PCLS above 25% and calculations logged as expected).

I have had a look at the D2R code and can see that it includes some bespoke updates, so not quite sure which part would be causing the difference. I am assuming it is to do with rounding somewhere, but just wondered if it was something obvious for me to look at and update? If you are able to have a quick look and advise, I can look to make any updates and carru out some testing to ensure it is working as expected.

Hello,

I have made an update to the GMP Values code which calculates/ projects the expected GMP in payment at GMP age and then applies the appropriate uplift after GMP age. This is always compared to the GMP deferred element values (that Schemes value in various ways) and any difference is moved to PRE97XS.

There was an error in the missed increases set up of the GMP Values code, whereby the future assumed missed increase percentage had not been set, whilst it was set on the deferred element reval. As such that small portion was being moved to PRE97XS unnecessarily. This has now been corrected to give the following results:

*TEST CASE 1: 822841*

!image-20250813-122428.png|width=323,height=150,alt=""image-20250813-122428.png""!

(Aside: We get £0.52 lower for the PRE88GMP calc, using the same factors as for POST88GMP and 52p rounding. This was noted in UAT testing and signed off, but just reminding here.)

!image-20250813-123134.png|width=230,height=159,alt=""image-20250813-123134.png""!

*TEST CASE 2: 821435*

We have now aligned the PRE/ POST88GMP element values and PCLS GMP value.

Note that the latest data for this member has a start point of £306.80 for reval, whereas on the calcs run in the ticket backing they were starting with £319.80. As such, the total GMP reval has reduced from £2,533.96 to £2,431.00.

Hello,

I have looked into this and either made coding updates or explained the reason behind our calculations, where we think the results are appropriate. 

I think the difference lies in the fact that Aurora will always use the latest factors available, where the revaluation end date is in the future. As these members are revaluing past DOR, to NPA, the code uses all known factors up to 2025 (even if past DOR, since the factor is known) and then uses 2.5% for any unknown years. There is no reason for the code to not apply the 2025 known s52 order, even if DOR is in 2024, as the revaluation end date is past 2025 for all of the cases provided.

I have set workings out below.

*_CASE 1:_*

Member 822175: Cat UNG

* Instructed during coding: if{{the date of retirement is before the normal pension age date, revalue to normal pension age date}}
* DOR: 17/12/2024
* NPA Date: 17/12/2029
* Leaving Date: 22/04/2002
* Years to revalue: 23 known years to 2025, 4 assumed years to 2029
* 23 known years = 1.904 (2025 orders)
* 4 assumed years = 1.025 (rate given by admin) ^ 4 = 1.1038*

**This is a correction we have made to the code after reviewing this query. Originally we calculated this as 5 years (age at NPA (60) less age at retirement (55) = 5 years) but this was resulting in a double counting of 1 year.*

As such, I think the calc is now correctly revaluing to a total of 27 years from DOL to NPA, it is just that Aurora gets 23 and 4 years, not 22 and 5 years. This makes sense, seen as the revaluation is up to 2029 and we have 2025 factors available, so would use all available years, before applying the assumed 2.5%.



*_CASE 2:_*

Member 822992 has the same logic applied:

* DOR: 09/12/2024
* NPA Date: 09/04/2026, so revalue to NPA as after DOR
* Leaving Date: 30/09/1995
* Years to revalue: 29 known years to 2025, 1 assumed years to 2026
* 29 known years = 2.208 (2025 orders)
* 1 assumed year = 1.025 (rate given by admin) ^ 1 = 1.025
* !image-20250812-142948.png|width=240,height=154,alt=""image-20250812-142948.png""!



*_CASE 3:_*

Member 822812 has the same logic for calculating number of known vs assumed years. 

*We have corrected the code to apply the fixed rate of 3.5% up to NPA. It was actually already doing this but our Information log was incorrectly also showing the 2.5% rate applied to non-GMP elements in the message, which we have removed.*

Workings: 

* Member DOL: 01/01/2022, GMP start date is April 2021
* DOR: 19/12/2024
* NPA: 19/12/2026, so member is revalued to NPA, since after DOR
* GMP revaluation end date prior to 2026 NPA would be April 2025 (since member is at GMP age of 60 on NPA).
* April 2021 to April 2025 = 4 years reval
* Aurora calc uses fixed reval of 1.035^4 = 1.1475
* Manual calc uses 1.035^3 = 1.108718 plus 1.035^2 = 1.0712, or a total of 1.035^5 = 1.187. *Our code does not allow for 5 years of reval, since the member is at GMP age at NPA, so the final GMP reval date is April 2025, not April 2026.*



Please check whether you are happy with the explanation above of reval years and how our global code works for both GMP and non-GMP elements. Please also check if you agree that GMP revals should be 4 years total for 

[~accountid:60e469e45cdb680071c94ff2] - Are you able to send this query back to admin? It is one of Gary’s tickets ready for UAT/ comment.

Until an alternative future revaluation method has been set up as requested by admin for this scheme (known reval DOD to DOR, then assumed reval DOR to NPA), I think this issue also has to remain pended.

Admin have provided the test cases with DORs in the past(2024, 2025). 

There can be scenario when DOR is in future and we have no rates for that year. It is unclear if we need to use latest rates in that case.

Could we arrange a test case with the DOR in the future?

Hi Chichi, I have tested a few more members (all male - I still need to check females) and agree that the future S148 GMP revaluation has been updated to 3%.

However, I have noticed an inconsistency with 1 member.

1018984 - NRD is 16/12/2032 - the system appears to be revaluing current revaluation to 30/11/2025 giving 9 years of revaluation at 1.497, whereas all other calcs are revaluing to calculation date which is giving 8 years revaluation of 1.468.

I do realise this is different from the initial request on this ticket, but I don't understand why this would be happening, when for all other members I have tested, they are using 8 years at 1.468. Can you check this out? I have attached a copy of the calc.

Hopefully, it is not me losing concentration on a Sunday afternoon!! Thanks.



Hi, I have just checked a female member - I agree the future S148 revaluation at 3% is correct, but this member also has the same excess revaluation issue as the member below. This female member is 1019260 - I have attached her calc too. Can you check this out please?

I have checked both members and provided a worked breakdown about how the known / assumed revaluation is being calculated. Calculate / Aurora is working in line with the standard methodology, so I don’t think there is an issue here.

I attach a copy of my worked breakdown examples for the two members. I will also confirm this to admin direct, as I am already in communication with Kathryn about the RSPCA tickets that have been raised.

I still need to look at a GMP issue attached to this ticket, so please do not close this off just yet.

Admin’s comments:

_Please find attached the correct calculations and screenshot of where Aurora is going wrong. We think it is due to the calc date. For Aurora we must enter 5th of the month, but the GMP Increments are effective from the 6th. The D2R spreadsheet used to code is Aurora is doing this correctly._

The attachments are available in the ServiceNow ticket, but I have also saved them here:

It looks like this issue is affecting both IBM schemes, so ticket [https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-307|https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-307|smart-link] also relates, however Admin don’t have an example member to provide.

Some members don’t even have that, and their pension increases only goes to 2022 or 2023.

I can’t see Production, so am curious to know if the pension increase data is up to date there, i.e. has the 2025 pension increases that were ran externally last year. Please can you check and advise because if the data isn’t updated, the PINCs calculation for 2026 will not work.

I also looked at member 1033980 as an example and the results on the spreadsheet do not match what is on Aurora CalcUAT. 

The spreadsheet states the valuation date is 19/02/2025 and the opening Post 1997 pension value is 1073.13, with a 1.017 pension increase applied, giving a final value of  1091.37 after the 2025 pension increase has been run.

However, the members Aurora CalcUAT record has the value after the 2024 pension increase has been applied as 3202.38. So this gives an immediate discrepancy between the spreadsheet and Aurora opening value, which will affect calculation results. 

I think before I continue, we need to determine whether the data held is actually correct and ready to use. It doesn’t appear so at the current time, unless I am missing something!

Thanks for your help with this.

The PINC spec confirms that there are 5 different groups within North South, with each group having a specific set of categories within it. All groups have the calculation run at the same date but I just wanted to check that admin would be running each group separate from each other, not all at the same time.

The calculation can handle this and it would be based on loading members in specific pension increase categories on Aurora to split them out. I just wanted to check this is the intention and this is how they would have been running the PINCs previously.

Thank you","12/Feb/26 2:36 PM;712020:848c5b3a-eb59-425b-9c6b-5139229b99dd;Hi [~accountid:712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29] please can you refer one more question to North South admin please.

In the spec, section 22 (line 49), it has been set that any rounding should be applied as ‘Add to Pre 97 Excess’, but this scheme doesn't have a Pre 97 pension element. The guidance notes in one of the other tabs confirms that if ‘Add to Pre 97 Excess’ or ‘Add to Post 97 Pension’ is used, all pensioners must have the element.

Therefore admin would need to either confirm that ‘Add to Post 97 Pension’ should be used instead (if all members have this) or use the other option, which is ‘Add to elements as specified in ‘Rounding Order’’. If they choose the latter option, please can they just confirm the rounding order in the list is correct.

Thank you ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To Do,11/Feb/26 1:27 PM

Admin are trying to run a Deferred Illustration calc for member 1491640 but it keeps erroring with the following:

|BAASchemeOverride: Object reference not set to an instance of an object|

The member has historic benefits.

I’ve tried running the calc in CalcTest but get the same error.  Member is 3272096 in CalcTest.

I’ve saved a word doc with screen prints of each stage of the calc, and finally the error in here:

\\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\BAA\HelpDesks\INC0206943 - Deferred Illustration Calc Error

In addition, when I try and check the calc parameters for the categories, I get an instant error (attached).

Wasn’t sure if the calc params was related so wanted to flag in here as well.  Shout if you want me to raise it separately.

Any problems, please let me know

Cheers

Sorry, there’s another member getting the same error when running def Illustration calcs.  I’ve run member 3268785 through in CalcTest and saved screenshots of each step in here:

The deferred benefits look ok, however this member does have Legacy benefits in the deferreds table and also has Historic Benefits.  Thought it worth mention as the member I initially raised this ticket for also has Legacy benefits and  Historic Benefits.

Shout if you need any more info.

I’m not sure why your live member 1511566 worked when it was run in November, but I can see that it doesn’t run now as the manual calc flag has been set.

Either way DPI’s should hopefully work for all members in CalcTest now. Note that I had to update the deferred elements for the members in this Jira; records must no longer use Post 88 GMP, Pre 97 Increasing Excess Transferred-in Post 88 GMP or Transferred-in Pre 97 Increasing Excess.

Could you please confirm whether this change applies exclusively to Active to Retired calculations? Since Active to Retired and Active to Deferred both use a shared method from the scheme module, I'm concerned that the change might affect Active to Deferred as well.

The pension increases on the ideal standard scheme were programmed as giving a pro rata increase based on the number of months retired.

I have re-run my original test cases and all still match, with the only differences being for 2 members that were previously having pro-rated increases applied. They are now having full increases applied instead, proving that the update has worked as expected.

Version 3 of the calculation has been updated and published. It is stored in the following client:

[https://calculate.calcuat.xpsplc.com/Clients/1032/Schemes/5434/Calculations/1|https://calculate.calcuat.xpsplc.com/Clients/1032/Schemes/5434/Calculations/1]


I had to make one update to the admin calc spec, to ensure the non-GMP rounding adhered to our house rules. I attach a copy of the updated calc spec v 1.3 for reference.

Please note, this client also has an Executive PINCs calculation that is separate but I have not made any changes to this version, since the calc spec does not refer to it. Therefore I have assumed this is working as expected and no updates required.

Should you require any additional information, please let me know.

Request from Admin 10/09:
We are noticing on a few calculations that Statutory Late GMP is not being calculated correctly. When we compare the Late GMP calculated by the calculator on the Intranet, the Aurora calcs do not provide the same result.

I have provided two examples of the Intranet calc (attached) whereby the Aurora Calc did not produce the same figures. Please could this be looked into?  These are saved here:

\\ad.xafinity.com\london\Data\Migration and Computerisation\Schemes\CapGemini\HelpDesks\INC0192930 - Late Payment of GMP Issue

Update from Admin 16/10:
Have just had confirmation that the internal calc referenced below uses 1.7% for future assumptions currently. As such, is it possible to amend the Late GMP calculations on Aurora, so that any future assumptions will use the last known Post 88 GMP increase? Or would this require us to request an update to the Aurora calc on a yearly basis (once the latest Statutory Post 88 GMP increase in known?

Please can you advise?

Any problems, please let me know

Admin have done a late retirement calculation for an in-service deferred member where they left employment AFTER their NRD.
The Status History shows that they left employment on 20/12/2022 but their NRD was 16/06/2021.

Unfortunately, the system is looking at the Status History line and is revaluing the benefit from the incorrect date left employment of 20/12/2022 rather than NRD of 16/06/2021.

Are you able to build something into the programming to say 'if DOL is later than NRD, use NRD as the revaluation date'?

I have had a look at this and it is failing because the member is aged 70 years 10 months at calculation date but the commutation factors only go up to age 70. The calculation is trying to work out an interpolated factor between ages 70 and 71 and failing because there is no age 71 factor.

If admin expect the calculation to work in such scenarios (and later ages), we would need confirmation of the extended commutation factor range to update in Calculate.

Admin have raised an error in the reval years and factor being used in the D>R calc, and they’ve advised it’s using early retirement factors ERF2 (as per spec) rather than ERF1.

I’ve saved a manual calc ‘McNamee ERQ no GMP.xlsx' and the Aurora calc ‘Aurora Calc.pdf’, and also a screenshot of the reval years 'NcNamee - Screenshot.png’

For Reval:

Manual calc has 

cell B29, DOL > NRD = 13 yrs - which agrees Aurora
cell B27, DOL > DOR = 11 yrs  - Aurora has 10 yrs (as per screenshot)
cell B31, Future yrs = 2 yrs - Aurora has 3 yrs (as per screenshot)

For ERF, cells B160 and 161, it’s interpolating using the table to the right in K158, which match the ERF1 table in the spec.  If I amend these to use the factors from ERF2, the final factors match Aurora.  

Please can you review and amend so that the calc in Aurora is using the reval yrs / factors and ERF1 as per the manual calc.

Not sure how urgent this Uni Of Stirling work is but yeah will be a minimum of a month probably before i can look at it (as also have a Hogg Robinson ticket to do which is urgent, just not as urgent as the new business)

I’ve got another ticket for Uni of Sterling, which I’ll raise another Jira for and link to this one, but looking again, I think the years may be correct, but the reval factor being used in Aurora is incorrect.

Years to use in the Aurora calc is 11 years
Reval factor being used in Aurora is 1.34 (10 years), whereas according to the manual calc and factors worksheet, the reval factor for 11 years is 1.356.

Hopefully this makes sense, but shout if any problems.

In relation to the incorrect reval issue, before we can proceed further we will need confirmation from admin (via an example using the same spreadsheets they used below) what they do if the DOR is in the future and on or past the NRD. As the way the spreadsheet they use is set up this will bring a future years amount of 0 which isn’t true if it’s revalued from today.

I checked the usages for 7067298 A>D calc in calculate and they're all there in prod, so this doesn't look like it's being used for a member of the wrong category. Could you guys take a wee look please?

My comments: I tested in Calc UAT for both Aurora Ids in question and the calculation is working for them. I checked the data in prod and it is exactly same as that in calc UAT. For now admin has ran the calc manually and updated the prod record to deferred status. As I cannot replicate the issue in CalcUAT, please can you confirm what the issue is help fix it.

Given the updated rates, testing the calculation using the 2025 rates isn't feasible. However, after running the calculation using current data and updated factors, it appears that the calculation is performing as expected.  I've attached a screenshot, and both the Aurora calculation and my calculation align. If the way Post14 and Post20 are calculated is currently incorrect, please can admin provide more details.

I understand that coding for an alternative approach for revaluation will be addressed in a different ticket [[IMPS-555] Uni of Glasgow - Revaluation method change - Jira|https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-555]. Could the admin please rerun the calculation to check for any discrepancies in the revaluation based the existing revaluation approach?

I've modified the code so that it aggregates all transfers in, causing the TVIN service to display the total sum of these transfers.

We either need to push ahead with a bespoke solution at a scheme level for this scheme, or, we wait for Andrew to have capacity to make global changes to our global revaluation code (unlikely to have capacity for this until Q2 next year due to Phase 5 being prioritised). 
Ideally, what i’d like to see is a zip file of worked example calcs (i appreciate the admin on the service now ticket is saying they’ve already given us that, but i disagree), also, a summary document of all correspondance on Service Now and email. If this isn’t done ahead of coding, then a coder will have to do all of that work to get to a point of ready to code, and if that’s what is needed then its what is needed, but can we please first try and provide:
- zip file with:
 - -  worked example test cases of how the calcs should be working (i can’t believe that existing test cases provided to us in phase 4 that we matched against are what we should be using now, we need fresh / new test cases worked through at today’s dates by the admin teams, if they can’t do this, we can’t proceed.)
 - - a summary word document of all the correspondance and info from admin, vs what we have gone back to them with, this needs collating into a document and reviewed by an analyst to summarise in its entirety please
  - - example aurora ids of the members they are producing new test cases for
- - example screenshots of calcs run on Aurora where the figures produced are wrong/ highlighted.

In some cases, this latter option will come up with a lower revaluation rate.

D>R (DfIS) calcs were in scope for phase 4. These have now been descoped from phase 4 as we have been waiting for Actuarial advice on Barber. Admin have been asked to raise a Calculation Support ticket to ensure work continues on the Calc. As its a Deferred in Service, there is also a requirement to code A>D and A>R calcs. Specifications and Test Cases have already been provided and are in the Schemes folder under Phoenix Phase 4 on Sharepoint. We will provide an update when we received the Actuary response to Barber in due course.



Readiness review:

Other tickets:

* Ticket [https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-530|https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-530|smart-link] relates to coding the D>R for “Deferred - Normal” members. Ignore such members in this ticket - this work is partially in progress.
* IMPS-503: Looking at Aurora there are Active members listed as “Active - Normal” and active members listed as “Active - Salary Linkage Closed DB”. The readiness review needs to establish:
** Do we need a “normal” A>D or A>R calc. From previous conversations with admin we thought there were only Deferred In service members held in active. 
** If a “normal” A>D and A>R calc is required, will this be a separate active calc to deferred in service members, or could be code both together? If separate, new Jira ticket required.

This ticket TO DO:

* For “Active - Salary Linkage Closed DB”: These are In-Service Deferred members, which this ticket relates to. New code required.
** Refer to Hogg Robinson A>D calc as an example of a calculation for In Service Deferred Members. They will likely have service up to closure and then statutory revaluation from closure to actual “normal deferred” date. It is possible to code an A>D for in service deferred within an active calc using the service builder and then statutory revaluation.
** Need to consider if you can also code the A>R this way, i.e. can an options builder be run through an active calc?
*** If yes, an A>R is to be coded for retiring in-service deferred members. 
*** If no, the procedure would likely be that members will have an A>D calc run to defer them and then a “normal” D>R calc run to retire them. This all needs to be considered in readiness review.
* Members have Barber and the actuary has not yet provided information for this. Cannot code the calcs until we have this.","23/Jul/25 3:28 PM;712020:ffa445ab-b813-4226-9ed2-507a454e9272;Hey [~accountid:712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29].

This was briefly raised during the transition in October 2024.  Please see attached email.

Mercer (the scheme actuaries) will be tabling a paper to the Trustee with their recommendations for changes to scheme factors together with options for implementing these (see attached latest email correspondence with Mercer).

LS comment:

I have tried to look into this and I’m assuming the GMPINC pension increase table on Aurora is used to calculate the Post 88 late payment inflation proofed GMP? If it is, should this table be at 06/04/YYYY, rather than 01/04/YYYY? The member reached GMP age 02/04/2023 and LRD is 01/04/2025, therefore there are the 06/04/2023 and 06/04/2024 missed GMP increases, Aurora looks to be only taking into account 1 missed increase.

There is also another Wavin Plastics Jira raised which also relates to the late payment of GMP (IMPS-449) this is currently assigned to Naomi.

*Resolution:*

Appeared to be two potential issues:

# GMPINC table did not have the latest known factor included, so it had to used an assumed rate (see point 2). I have updated the table to include the 1.7%, which now feeds through, but I have not updated the effective from date from 01/04 to 06/04 as it can vary per scheme and so we’d need admin to sign off on that date change. Let me know if that is required, or whether using 1.7% for the retirement date 01/04/2025 is correct. This member happens to be retiring on what we currently have in as the GMPINC effective date.
# We did not have any assumed revaluation factor set for the scheme, which would be used where the retirement date was later than the latest GMPINC available. I have set that to be 3%, but can edit it based on whether they want an assumed factor applied for unknown years or not. 

Here is the result when I just updated the “assumed factor” which matches admins calc and gave no 01/04/2025 factor:

!image-20250729-102132.png|width=265,height=279,alt=""image-20250729-102132.png""!

Here is the result when I then updated GMPINC to include the known 2025 factor of 1.7, which I believe would now be the correct value, bringing it back down slightly:

At the time this was raised, Sonya, Pete, Naomi and I had a meeting about the fix for all schemes as a new global table was to be created, we were going to wait for Wavin to be fixed as part of the global table update, but this has been around for a while now, so if you want to do a temporary fix for Wavin now, happy with that. 

Do you know where the global table update is at the moment? It’s just that it is coming up to April again and if this isn’t updated before April all the scheme level late payment GMP tables will need to be updated again, but I appreciate this is probably lower down on the priority list at the moment.","15/Jan/26 2:09 PM;712020:848c5b3a-eb59-425b-9c6b-5139229b99dd;Hi [~accountid:6267ed2b357b9f006e4b8c69] I have updated the GMP increase table for Wavin so that all entries start with 6th April each year. I have re-run the test cases for member 788087 and this now matches the admin spreadsheet expected results. I have also checked that the same results are produced in Aurora CalcUAT.

I haven’t tested any other members other than 788087 and the only updates made were to the GMP increase table. This is now ready for admin to do their own UAT to ensure they are happy with the updates made. Once admin are happy, the same GMP increase table updates will need to be made in Aurora Production (I assume by App Support).

So the above named scheme is an anniversary PINCs (i.e. the increase is based on the day they retired). Members are also paid on the day they retired, too. The payroll period covers 6th-5th.

The PINCs run fine through PenScope for those with pay dates of 6th-31st, but the ones who have pay dates of 1st-5th of the following month never run through, and therefore are done manually.

I am happy to have a discussion about this, or whether my suggestion is feasible, but I think what may work and be beneficial is having PINC groups.

so, those that retired between 6th April - 5th May would have the PINC group P1.
6th May - 5th June PINC group P2. 

Etc.

Please let me know if this can be implemented and how we'd go about it.",,Callum Lord,Caz Dunne,Donald,Luke Ruffman,Peter Dimsdale,Sonya Howarth,,,,,621ce5ee932f0f007165b575,60e469e45cdb680071c94ff2,712020:e960b04b-2df7-4f4b-bce8-14ee0e29228c,712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7,712020:4ae9d5fc-68f8-4200-815c-99a10ae0957f,712020:379ee819-d969-4af1-a2dd-ab2ccf81df5a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SCHEME-378,,,,18/Jul/25 11:27 AM;8243c668-c885-42e0-bfa4-8d0eeb91c8b1;Lithgows PINCS - Parameters v4.0.txt;https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/10242,04/Jul/25 3:26 PM;8243c668-c885-42e0-bfa4-8d0eeb91c8b1;Lithgows PINCS teams transcript to 04.07.25 1521.docx;https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/10229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@647e1d28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.1,,,Z:\Schemes\Lithgows\Helpdesks\INC0179392 - Change to anniversary pincs 1-5 of following month,,,,,,Significant / Large,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0|i00gov:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calculation Fix,,,Configuration Change,,,,INC0179392,,https://xpsprod.service-now.com/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Penscope,,,,,,,,,aafdc98f-7c81-4662-bbbb-cc5465f1df35,Calcs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-07-04 14:33:17.191,10007_*:*_1_*:*_344024455_*|*_10249_*:*_3_*:*_8013854_*|*_10282_*:*_1_*:*_2853_*|*_10284_*:*_2_*:*_7107_*|*_10409_*:*_1_*:*_6660825151_*|*_10244_*:*_2_*:*_5087115042_*|*_10246_*:*_1_*:*_4717,,"04/Jul/25 3:33 PM;712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7;Analysis for [~accountid:621ce5ee932f0f007165b575] and [~accountid:712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29] 

Simplifying slightly, but it looks like there’s a line of code which effectively says for monthly, if the most recent pension history event* date is in the month after the month of the increase, the members won’t be picked up.

A thought to try to workaround this could be to separate the members into 2 groups (assumption below that 1 to 5 are the days wanted). I haven’t tried this, and it may not work as you want - but is this something you could try out if you think worthwhile? If it is something you’d like to try and it does appear to work, we could investigate a bit further and maybe propose this as a workaround. If you decide to try this and want me to create two pension increase groups so you can assign to members in CalcTest please let me know.

The hypothetical idea is that pensioners who have their most recent pension history event* with a day of 1 to 5 would go into one group (Group2), and the other pensioners would go into another group (Group1).

It would mean running increases twice.

Group1 would run at the current increase date interval, and Group2 would run with an increase date of the 1st of the following month.

e.g. If Group1 runs with 06/04, then Group2 runs with 01/05.

The theory being Group1 would run as it currently is, and Group2 would run the members in the following month, but this list would be restricted owing to pension increase Group2 being only those in the 1-5 day range. I don’t know if this would end up giving the right dates in the right fields.

I've updated the pincs side of things on CalcDev so the start point is now aligned - this is based on CalcTest and our copy of live (which has the 2 weekly refresh).
This isn't a full scheme migration - instead I've manually updated the pinc setup tables on calcdev.

On calcdev I have:

* Removed the pension increase group ‘July’ from 10 members
* Removed the pension increase groups ‘July’
* To realign, I have then renamed the remaining increase group from ‘non July’ to ‘all scheme’, and updated the parameters
-   Increase type - have set to ‘Monthly Annual Increases’
-   Multiple pincs groups - set to ‘one pension increase group’. Note my exercise was to set the realign the parameters, so it may be that you then change this parameter again
-   For pension rounding, the element_id at rounding order 28 was different on calcdev compared to live and calctest - the element name on the rounding table is ‘Payment Post 2005 Pen CPI 2.5% Max (Info Only)’ - the element pointed to on calcdev was ‘Payment Post 2005 Pen CPI 2.5% Max (Info Only)’, but on calctest and live it pointed to ‘Payment Post 97 Pen CPI esc 5% Max (Info Only)’. I’ve updated calcdev to make the starting point consistent with live. It is curious why it points to that element, but I suspect this is so far down the rounding element list it might just be academic.

If you're able to check against live to see if the starting point now matches that would be good.

And also if you let me know the names of the new pension increase groups you want added I'll script them in, and then you can attach whichever pensioners you want to those groups (member pensioners page), and then you can amend parameters.

For info calctest / calcdev are behind live in some respects, e.g. looks like live has additional categories",08/Jul/25 3:00 PM;712020:4ae9d5fc-68f8-4200-815c-99a10ae0957f;hi  [~accountid:712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7]please move the status to ‘in coding’ if that is correct? thanks,"08/Jul/25 3:16 PM;712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7;Checked with Pete, assigning to Callum (or Donna) to take forward","08/Jul/25 3:25 PM;621ce5ee932f0f007165b575;Hi [~accountid:712020:22ef4a49-0bf2-40d1-b89d-fb1b26752da7] , admin have confirmed they’re happy for us to have a crack at the two increase group approach.

Admin have completed their testing in CalcTest for Lithgows PINCs and they have commented as follows:

Hi Callum,

I can confirm that we’ve completed a review of the Calc Test against the Live report for the September increase. Please find our findings below

* 6th to End of Month Category:

Upon comparison, we identified three members present in the Live report who were missing from the Calc Test. These members have increase dates that fall within the 6th to EOM range. Additionally, the Calc Test included increases for three members who have exited (deceased), which should not have occurred.

* 1st to 5th of Next Month Category:

The Calc Test did not generate any results for this category. However, the Live report flagged seven members under “Members that have not been increased that should have been increased.” These members have increase dates between the 1st and 5th of the following month.

Summary:

The Calc Test failed to include the relevant members for the 1st to 5th of next month category and incorrectly processed increases for exited members in the 6th to EOM category.

Callum is still out of office so picking up on his behalf.

Please can you advise?

I can’t change the status of this ticket to Readiness Review, so can you change for me please?

Any problems, please let me know

Having scanned the below, I think you did the PINCs script for this, and prior to that I created a script for adding a couple of pension increase groups - details of which are below (the groups will need to exist in the environment before the pincs script is released).

From the below, I don’t think any scheme coding was carried out.

As such I think you should be able to find the relevant scripts (the pension increase group script, and the pincs script) and this could be handled in house. You mention below about members being assigned into groups, so that’s a consideration too.

Admin have done some testing in calcuat on the enhanced ER calcs and have following feedback. 

Firstly, Aurora seems to be correctly identifying when the process should and shouldn’t be ran E.G Active over age 62 and with 15 years’ service, the majority of calcs I have ran have also been okay.
They have however noticed a couple of issues;
799324 - run the calc for age 62 and Aurora has worked out the benefits correctly. However, ran a further calc for 61 and 10 months, again the system has correctly worked out that an ERF should be applied however it doesn’t seem to have applied it to the pre 97 tranche. They are struggling to reconcile the Post 97 tranche but the post 16 + post 20 tranches are calculating correctly.
797601 - Having issues reconciling the cash comm calc it looks like Aurora has set aside Post EQ GMP but it should have set aside all GMP. They need to ensure that there is enough Pre 97 left to cover GMP but Pre and Post 97 also have different cash factors for this section (Foden) so having more taken from the pre 97 Tranche is also overinflating the cash amount.",31/Oct/25 11:18 AM;712020:a6b9ea69-b354-452e-8226-f88552409f29;Can I have an update please,11/Nov/25 8:47 AM;712020:f38eeb13-b2c0-4af4-91ba-580f458ba135;I think in order for coders to proceed on this one we will need worked excel examples for members 799324 and 797601 mentioned below.

Long story short, what has happened here is that the reval has changed from statutory, to actual reval for the specific month.  E.g RPI from March 03 to April 09, and then separately CPI from April 09 to date of leaving.  Alongside this, the scheme is going to buy-in, so changes to the factors are likely and perhaps the way they are applied.  All in all, it could be a meaty piece of work, so please bear that in mind.

Admin have commented as follows:

_the example member initially used was 72035. Please see attached a screenshot of the Aurora calc with the incorrect value for 'N' and a copy of the D2R spreadsheet which is calculating the value of 'N' correct. Unfortunately, this member is now a pensioner and as this is quite a niche area (whereby DOE and NRD fall in the same month), we have not located another example member yet. However, this will need fixing ahead of any other potential members. Thank you. If you need anything else, please let us know._

PINCS - On all categories - the 2024 PINCs are not rounded and the first pro-rated PINC is not rounded. For example, Aurora is not rounding up the missed PINCS for part months i.e. it is using 0.4666667 instead of 0.47 for an NRD of 06/08/2020 where the April 2021 PINC was 0.70.

Chichi did this a number of times, as you can see below, but it doesn’t appear we have anything as yet. Please can you chase them up again for some examples of the issue and the expected results.

Admin’s comments:

I can confirm this issue affects all categories and any member where a late retirement calculation is being produced and a pro-rated PINC is being applied. i.e. it is using 0.4666667 instead of 0.47 for an NRD of 06/08/2020 where the April 2021 PINC was 0.70. We need all proportionate PINCs to be rounded to 2dcp.

Example members 42487, 41622, 14235, 8652, 17095, 90347, 51966

Ticket [https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-266|https://xps-jira.atlassian.net/browse/IMPS-266|smart-link] also relates, as the issue is affecting both IBM schemes.

Is this enough to proceed, or do you need anything else?

Any problems, please let me know

Cheers
